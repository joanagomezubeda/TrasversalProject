            <h3><span><i class="bi bi-book-fill me-2"></i></span>Our Story</h3>
            <p>BookLends began with a <strong>simple idea</strong>: stories are meant to be shared — and so are books.
                We’re a team of <strong>readers, dreamers, and community builders</strong> who grew up swapping books with friends,
                scribbling notes in margins, and <strong>falling in love</strong> with characters we'd never forget.
            </p>
            <p>One day, we realized: what if <strong>lending and borrowing books could happen with readers everywhere, not just your closest friends?</strong>
                What if your favorite novel could find its way into someone else’s hands — and start a whole new adventure?
            </p>
            <p>So we built <strong>BookLends</strong>: a friendly corner of the internet where book lovers can <strong>connect</strong>, share, lend, borrow, and discover new favorites together.
                No dusty library cards, no waiting lists — <strong>just real people and real books</strong>, traveling from shelf to shelf, heart-to-heart.
            </p>
            <p>Today, BookLends is a growing community of readers from all <strong>walks of life</strong>, united by a love for stories and a belief that a shared book is a shared experience.
                And we’re just getting started.
