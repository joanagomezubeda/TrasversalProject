    <div class="mt-3">
        <p>Hello, <strong>fellow bookworm!</strong> Welcome to BookLends, the place where stories (and books!) are meant to be shared.
            Before you dive into swapping novels and meeting fellow readers, we want to be <strong>crystal clear</strong> about how we protect your <strong>personal info.</strong></p>
        <p>Because while we love open books, your <strong>privacy</strong> is a story only you should control.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="whatCollect mt-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">1. What We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you hang out with us on <strong>BookLends</strong>, you might share:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profile Info:</strong> Your name, username, profile picture, favorite genres, and a short bio about yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Details:</strong> Your email address and general location (so we can match you with <strong>nearby readers</strong> — no random strangers from across the globe asking to borrow your copy of Pride and Prejudice).</li>
                <li><strong>Book Lists and Activity:</strong> Books you own, are lending out, want to borrow, or have marked as "must-read ASAP."</li>
                <li><strong>Community Interactions: </strong> Posts, reviews, likes, comments, private messages, and any other magic you sprinkle across the site.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="howUse mt-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">2. How We Use It</h3>
            <p>We use <strong>your</strong> info to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personalize your <strong>BookLends experience</strong> (hello, recommendations you’ll actually love!).</li>
                <li>Help you <strong>connect</strong> with fellow readers nearby for <strong>lending and borrowing.</strong></li>
                <li>Keep the BookLends <strong>community safe</strong>, welcoming, and free from trolls.</li>
                <li>Send you updates you’ll <strong>actually care about</strong> (like when someone wants to borrow your copy of The Night Circus).</li>
                <li>Improve our site — because just like books get new editions, we want BookLends to keep <strong>getting better</strong> too.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="sharingInf mt-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">3. Sharing Info</h3>
            <p>Your personal story <strong>stays yours.</strong> We <strong>never</strong> sell your information. Ever.</p>
            <p>We may share <strong>limited</strong> info (like your username and city) to help with book swaps, but only <strong>what’s needed</strong> to make the magic happen.</p>
            <p>And of course, if the law taps us on the shoulder, we might have to share <strong>certain info</strong> — but only when absolutely necessary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="yourChoices mt-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">4. Your Choices</h3>
            <p>On BookLends, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust your <strong>privacy settings</strong> anytime (like hiding your profile from public search).</li>
                <li>Decide what parts of your profile are <strong>visible</strong> to others.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> if you ever need a break from book swapping (but we hope you stay!).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe privacy should be <strong>simple, not scary.</strong></p>
